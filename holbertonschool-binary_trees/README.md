I asked several AI Helpers to tell me a joke about binary trees. Most were bad but I couldn't leaf this one be.
---------------------------------
A young binary tree walks into a bar and orders a drink. The bartender says, "Hey, kid, you're not old enough to be in here!"

The tree replies, "But I'm 1010!"

The bartender squints at the tree. "Look, even counting every leaf and twig, you're still just ten."

The tree shrugs. "Guess I'm rooted out again."
