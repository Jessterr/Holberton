# Hash Tables

"Hash tables mirror the organizational structure of modern libraries by efficiently cataloging and storing information. Similar to how libraries categorize books using specific criteria for easy retrieval, hash tables organize data through key-value pairs, ensuring quick access and retrieval of stored information in computer systems. Both systems optimize efficiency by arranging content strategically for swift access and management."  -ChatGPT
