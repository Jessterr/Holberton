# Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. Computer programming tasks that require bit manipulation include low-level device control, error detection and correction algorithms, data compression, encryption algorithms, and optimization.

unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);
void print_binary(unsigned long int n);
int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);
int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);
int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);
unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);
```
