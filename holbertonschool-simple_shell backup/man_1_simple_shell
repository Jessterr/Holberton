simple_shell

.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
Simple_shell is a project dedicated to our studies. My partner and I, have tried to mimic the behavior of the original shell language. Shell is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file. This simple_shell project isn't intended to be an exact imitation of the original Unix shell.

.SH OVERVIEW
This was made to complete the C simple_shell project at Holberton. The README.md file provided to give a better documentation of this program.

.SH FEATURES
* This program displays a prompt and waits for the user to input a command.A command line always ends with a new line (when user pushes the ENTER key).

* The promt is displayed each time a command has been executed.

* When the user enters 'exit', the program will end and reutrn the status to 0.
